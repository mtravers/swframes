Ideas.

Frame sources should be CLOS objects 
       (DONE for SPARQL).  
     (DONE in anstract)

In-memory and SPARQL endpoints should have a common (or partially common) API.  

In-memory frames can have slot indexes for quicker lookup. But we probably don't
want to make a whole in-memory SPARQL implementation (or maybe we do, it's not
that hard).

Theory of dirtiness (Not yet implemented):
- frames have a slot of dirty predicates.
- there is a global (or per-sparql) list of dirty frames

Theory of slot values
- always a list
- should deprecate set-slotv, add-triple is the appropriate API
- should keep inverses

- should use rdfs typing
